                               <p>Hazel Grace Lancaster, not your average teenager, was diagnosed with stage 4 terminal thyroid cancer that spread into her lungs and requires her to walk around with an oxygen tank.  </p>
                               <p>She did not want to become close with anyone because she knew time on earth would soon expire for her. </p>
                               <p>She would attend a support group where she came across a boy named Augustus Waters that was there to support a mutual friend Isaac.  </p>
                               <p>Augustus had osteosarcoma a type of bone cancer that begins in the cells that form bones he is now cancer free with an amputated leg. After the support group meeting is over Augustus walks over to Hazel and invites her to his house. </p>
                               <p>She ends up accepting his offer they both talk about cancer and their favorite books. </p>
                               <p>They begin to bond over each other's favorite books. The two have been almost inseparable since the first time they met. He invites her on a Dutch-themed picnic and over time she realizes that she likes him a lot, but she knows she'll hurt him when she dies. She compares herself to a grenade because she knows her life could end any minute. Hazel's lungs start filling with fluid which sends her to the ICU he never left her side as he waited a few days for her release in the waiting room.  </p>
                               <p>He reveals that a charitable foundation that grants wishes of kids with cancer has agreed to grant his so he's taking the children with cancer to Amsterdam to meet Van Houten who is the author of Hazel's favorite book.  </p>
                               <p>Her parents don’t think Hazel is healthy enough to travel. Dr. Maria, one of the doctors that are familiar with them convinces them that she must travel because she needs to live her life.  </p>
                               <p>Plans were arranged for Augustus, Hazel, and Hazel’s mother to go to Amsterdam. They get ready to met Van Houten and he did not meet the expectations and wouldn't answer any questions. </p>
                               <p> Augustus and Hazel share a romantic kiss at the end of Anne Franks's tour and the two go back to the hotel where they make love for the first and only time. The day after, he confesses that while she was in the ICU he had a body scan which revealed his cancer has returned and spread all over. They return, and Hazel realizes Augustus is now just like her. As his condition worsens he loses his character and becomes vulnerable and scared.    </p>
                               <p>She gives him the nickname Gus and she realizes that she loves him. As his health deteriorates Augustus arranges a prefuneral for himself, and Isaac and Hazel give eulogies. </p>
                               <p>Hazel shares the love she has for Augustus, and how she would not trade their time together for anything in the world. He dies eight days later. </p>
                               <p>A few days later Isaac informs Hazel that Augustus was writing something for her. He had hinted about writing a sequel to for her, and as Hazel scrambles to locate the pages she encounters Van Houten once more. He drunkenly reveals that Anna was the name of his daughter. She died of cancer when she was eight and was his literary attempt at reconciling himself with her death. Hazel tells Van Houten to sober up and write another book.   </p>
